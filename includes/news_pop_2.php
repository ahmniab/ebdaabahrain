			  <p> Ebdaa Bank for Microfinance is prepared for the release of the Guide for Home-based Entrepreneurs following the directives of HRH Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander and First Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
			  <p>CEO of Ebdaa Bank for Microfinance, Dr. Khalid Al Ghazzawi, praised the directives of HRH and confirmed the preparedness of Ebdaa Bank, supported by the Arab Gulf Development Program (AGFUND), to create the guide and assist home-based entrepreneurs in effectively utilizing it. A large segment of Ebdaa Bank’s clients are home-based entrepreneurs who borrow funds to grow their projects.</p>
			  <p>“The increasing trend towards home projects in Bahrain may result in security and safety risks. As part of its national role in adopting and implementing Bahrain’s Economic Vision 2030, Ebdaa Bank is fully prepared to contribute to the formulation of this guide while supporting the efforts of the Ministry of Labour and Social Development and the Ministry of Health,” said Dr. Al Ghazzawi.</p>
			  <p>Given its area of expertise which includes assisting Bahraini entrepreneurs and financing micro and small projects, Ebdaa Bank has the ability to largely contribute to the creation of the guide along with government officials. “We welcome the initiative and are pleased to fulfill this responsibility through our accumulated experience with home projects in the Kingdom of Bahrain and in the nine Arab countries where the banks of AGFUND operate,” he said.</p>
			  <p>“We will stress the urgency of appropriate security and safety systems to our customers for their projects, and the need to rely on equipment that automatically stops in the event of a short circuit or gas leak,” he concluded.</p>
			  <p>Ebdaa Bank was established in 2009 as the first microfinance bank in the Kingdom of Bahrain through the support of HRH Princess Sabeeka Bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa, the wife of the King of Bahrain and the President of the Supreme Council for Women, and the Late Prince Talal Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, the President of the Arab Gulf Programme for Development (AGFUND).</p>

			   <p>Ebdaa Bank reported net profits exceeding BD 306,000 for the financial year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a profit of BD 94,000 in 2017. The increase in net profits is reported to be due to the increase in the volume of operations apart from the number and value of disbursed loans. Operating as a social business, Ebdaa Bank confirmed that profits will be re-injected into the bank’s capital to increase the number and value of low-income loans, helping more Bahrainis to start and/or improve their micro and small businesses and serving the national economy in accordance with the Bahrain 2030 Vision.</p>
			   <p>In its statement on the performance of 2018, Ebdaa Bank reported that its assets increased by over 24% from around BD 2.45 million in 2017 to over BD 3.05 million at the end of 2018. The net loan portfolio increased from BD 1.6 million in 2017 to approximately BD 2.1 million in 2018, an increase of 31%. While the bank’s operational income increased by 40% in 2018, the Bank managed to control its operating expenses, which only increased by 10.7% in 2018, compared to 2017.</p>
			   <p>Ebdaa Bank successfully recovered nearly BD 64,000 from the provision for doubtful debts, as a result of increased efforts in the collection of outstanding loans and arrears from previous years.</p>
			   <p>Chairwoman of the Board of Directors of Ebdaa Bank, Mrs. Mona Yousef Al Moayyed, expressed her satisfaction with the continued development of the Bank’s operations and commitment to serve low-income Bahraini clients.“Enhancing the bank’s ability to lend is very important, at this time, as it contributes to national efforts to encourage retirees of the voluntary retirement program to launch their own businesses,” said Ms. Al Moayyed.</p>
			   <p>“It further encourages micro, small and medium enterprises to generate more jobs in response to the requirements of the National Employment Program,” she added.</p>
			   <p>Mrs. Al Moayyed expressed her appreciation for Bahrain’s leadership in its efforts to serve low-income clients. “The shareholders and board of directors would like to express our gratitude to the Bahraini businessmen and businesswomen who have provided the bank with interest-free financing this year,” she said.</p>
			   <p>In her statement, Mrs. Al Moayyed appreciated the CBB’s support of the microfinance industry in the Kingdom of Bahrain and its recent decision to reduce the minimum capital of microfinance banks from BD 5 million to BD 2 million, thereby expanding the microfinance base, from BD 5000 to BD 7000. “The Tamkeen Labor Fund has also contributed to our success and has provided continued support to Ebdaa Bank’s programs, performance and staff, particularly in the areas of technical development, training and payment support,” she stated.</p>
			   <p>“We look forward to working with Tamkeen this year on initiatives related to expanding the base of female borrowers, by providing the loan portfolio with a capital grant of BD 500,000, and launching the first phase of the Youth Support Program with a similar amount,” she revealed.</p>
			   <p>Chief Executive Officer of Ebdaa Bank, Dr. Khalid Al-Gazawi stated that the fruitful results achieved over the past four years by Ebdaa Bank are mainly due to the implementation of AGFUND methodologies and standards in the field of microfinance. “Ebdaa Bank has become an example in the success of microfinance institutions in Bahrain and the rest of the region,” said Dr. Al- Ghazzawi.</p>
			   <p>“We would also like to recognize the efforts of and thank our staff at different locations for their outstanding efforts in developing the Bank’s performance,” he added.</p>
			   <p>Ebdaa Bank was able to disburse over 2,600 loans to its new and repeat customers, amounting to over BD 2.6 million, in 2018. “The bank’s plan for the next five years focuses on serving 10,000 borrowers including existing and new customers with loans worth over BD 10 million,” he stated.</p>
			   <p>“The plan also includes the opening of branches in Muharraq, Saar and Sitra,” he added.
                 Dr. Al-Gazawi thanked the shareholders and all partners for their cooperation with Ebdaa Bank. “The Arab Gulf Development Program also plays a tremendous role in supporting the bank through the AGFUND model in financial management, which led to the Bank’s success in overcoming challenges faced since its establishment. We are highly pleased with this advanced stage of success,” he concluded.</p>

                 <p>Dr. Khalid Waleed Al Ghazawi, CEO of Ebdaa Bank, partook in “Middle East Investment Conference” in Cairo, Egypt where international thought leaders, policymakers and key market participants are gathered to discuss trends shaping the Middle East and North Africa region, as well as its role in the global economy.</p>
                 <p>Dr. Khalid Waleed Al Ghazawi, CEO of Ebdaa Bank, called for greater integration of microfinance industry in the Arab world and to enhance its development which provides funding and training for SMEs in the region, especially in countries such as Egypt, Sudan, Mauritania and Jordan.</p>
                 <p>During a session in “Middle East Investment Conference 2018” hosted by CFA Society Egypt, Dr. Khalid stressed that greater attention is paid by governments and decision makers to microenterprises which contribute significantly to self-sufficiency in goods and services.</p>
                 <p>“Without underestimating the importance of attracting large foreign investment, we should also be mindful of stimulating and encouraging what can be called local small investors through the provision of affordable financing and training opportunities.” Said Dr. Khalid</p>
                 <p>Dr. Al-Ghazawi reviewed aspects of the Kingdom's advanced experience in supporting SMEs through enabling environment for innovation and entrepreneurship by institutions such as the Economic Development Board, Tamkeen, the Bahrain Development Bank, the Supreme Council for Women and others.</p>
                 <p>“SMEs make up more than 80% of private enterprises in most countries of the region, but do not contribute more than 40% of GDP, so we are constantly challenging how to finance and develop these institutions and increase their activities and competitiveness.” Said Dr. Khalid</p>
                 <p>Dr. Al Ghazawi, with more than 20 years of experience in microfinance around the world, pointed out the difference between sustainable microfinance provided by financial institutions operating according to clear administrative standards and donations provided by charities, stressing the confusion of the two concepts continued to affect development efforts.</p>
                 <p>“Although the capital of the SMEs is mainly from donors, our work requires lending to those in need and ensuring the success of their projects and retrieving the loan to grant it to another needy person. This is, of course, different from grants, zakat or charitable giving.” Said CEO of Ebdaa Bank Dr. Al Ghazawi</p>
                 <p>On a related level, Dr. Al Ghazawi stressed the importance of SMEs to ensure their sustainability and cope with advanced banking methods in legislation and risk management such as Blockchain and Fentech and others, in addition to innovating in providing loans and be their partners in their success through consultations and support in commensurate with the nature of business in Arab countries.</p>
                 <p>He considered that SMEs’ success shouldn’t be measured through the number of loans or beneficiaries, however in loans returns and profit and in measuring the number of projects that have already been able to grow bigger without external support.  </p>
                 <p>This success will contribute to the expansion of financial services to micro-enterprises; reduce the funding gap in this sector, encourage the establishment and licensing of microfinance companies and the availability of funding resources.</p>

                 <p>Dr Al Ghazawi assured that the new strategy is based largely on two axes: AGFUND’s adopted strategy under the guidance and blessing of His Highness Prince Talal Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud and the national plan to achieve SDGs adopted by the Kingdom of Bahrain.</p>
                 <p>“Despite the narrow legislative framework through which Ebdaa Bank operates, the bank will seek to develop and adjust its strategy in lending products, loan procedures and policies, customer selection, and marketing campaign through social media to achieve the 17 SDGs 2030 approved by the United Nations and adopted by the Kingdom of Bahrain.” Said Dr Al Ghazawi</p>
                 <p>“Ebdaa Bank is achieving a number of SDGs even before this comprehensive review, the bank backs the neediest in Bahrain through providing loans without guarantees and guidance services towards achieving the 17 SDGs. Our commitment to achieve these goals is a voluntary commitment stemming from a high sense of responsibility to be an active part of the national, regional and global efforts.”  Said Dr Al Ghazawi</p>
                 <p>He added: “Since the bank’s establishment, it has been providing loans to more than nine thousand borrowers and currently serves more than 2300 borrowers, meaning we contribute to the establishment of a large number of micro enterprises in the Kingdom of Bahrain. We are working to achieve development conducive to a comprehensive, environment-friendly economic prosperity, ensuring peace and prosperity, and making science, technology and innovation available to all in order to achieve development with a human dimension.”</p>
                 <p>Dr Al Ghazawi stressed that achieving the fifth goal of the SDGs aimed at “Gender Equality” is reflected in the prudent practices of the bank internally through non-discrimination between employees of both sexes in employment, salaries, allowances, and promotions. It is also evident in the non-discrimination among borrowers on the basis of sex, religion, color, or race.</p>
                 <p>CEO of Ebdaa Bank highlighted the eighth goal “Decent Work and Economic Growth”, stressing the keenness of the bank to provide conducive environment to suit employees competencies and aspiration. It also contributes in national economy development through granting loans to microenterprises.</p>
                 <p>Dr Al Ghazawi affirmed his keenness to consult with all civil society actors, the private sector and local authorities in order to ensure the achievement of sustainable development goals as effectively as possible.</p>

                 <p>Ebdaa Bank has agreed with a proposal to microfinance project adopted by charities due to its sustainability to develop their financial resources thus to achieve their objectives to support low-income families. At a time that donations are very less compared to the people needs.</p>
                 <p>CEO of Ebdaa Bank Dr Waleed Al Ghazawi welcomed Almajdouie Group, stressing the need of GCC to adopt microfinance due to its benefit for charity donations.</p>
                 <p>This concept would help more citizens to launch their business venture through which national private sector can provide local market needs of services and products and would provide job vacancies. </p>
                 <p>Dr Al Ghazawi stressed the keenness of Ebdaa Bank to provide institutions and charities with necessary expertise which would develop their business. The success of Microfinance experience is considered a leading model for charity institutions to develop their business to advanced levels. </p>
                 <p>CEO of Ebdaa Bank said, “Microfinance policy is based on a simple concept referred to a proverb that says “do not feed a fish to hungry, he would ask for more however teach him how to be fisher.” Microfinance is based on exploring actual needs of people to launch their own business through giving advice, consultation, training and follow-up until he can take charge of his project himself.”</p>
                 <p>Almajdouie Group visits Bahrain to share ideas and experience through which it would develop their sustainable charity projects. Addressing poverty through Microfinance would support the new project of Almajdouie Group “Basta”, where six booths were launched in KSA distributed in Dammam and Al Khobar.</p>
                 <p>This project aims to support Kiosks to develop their projects. It is applied in many developing countries and has had a major impact on addressing poverty. </p>
