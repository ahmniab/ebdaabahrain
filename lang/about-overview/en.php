    "paragraph_1" => 'Ebdaa Microfinance Bahrain was established (as a bank) on February 11, 2009, as the first bank specialized in microfinance in the Kingdom of Bahrain, under the gracious patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa, wife of the King of Bahrain and President of the Supreme Council for Women, may God protect her, and the late Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, founder of the Arab Gulf Programme for Development (AGFUND). This was based on the belief in the role of such banks in supporting low-income individuals and contributing to unleashing their creativity and achieving their ambitions by providing small loans with easy and facilitated conditions. The legal status of Ebdaa changed from a bank to a company in mid-2021 in implementation of the new regulatory instructions of the Central Bank of Bahrain.

Since its establishment, Ebdaa has been providing all possible support to low-income individuals and small business owners, aiming to increase citizens\' income and improve their standard of living by turning their talents and crafts into successful projects, through providing micro and small loansâ€”with a focus on women and youth. Additionally, Ebdaa manages the financial portfolio of Her Royal Highness Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa to support and economically empower women, in cooperation with the Supreme Council for Women and the Labor Fund "Tamkeen".

Ebdaa offers financing in both Islamic and conventional formats. Ebdaa received the "Best Women Empowerment in the GCC" award from the Government of Dubai in May 2017 in recognition of its role in supporting and economically empowering Bahraini women, and was also honored as the Best Microfinance Bank by the Union of Arab Banks in 2023.',
